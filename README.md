# code-quality

Include following things into your project to include `code-quality`:

```
{
    "require": {
        "wunderio/code-quality": "master"
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "repositories": {
        "code-quality": {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "git@github.com:wunderio/code-quality.git"
        }
    }
}
```

In future we will have it as regular composer package for easier installation.
